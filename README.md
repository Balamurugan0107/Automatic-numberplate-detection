# Automatic-numberplate-detection
The Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPD) project uses Python to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video streams. By leveraging computer vision techniques and libraries like OpenCV, the system processes images, isolates the number plate, and applies optical character recognition (OCR) to extract plate.
